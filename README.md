# JVC Projector Control
This is an Android app to control your JVC projector over the network. 
# Installation
In releases, download the APK, install it, and that's it. 
# Usage
Upon first launch the app should have a guide to help you get set up, but if not the instructions are here as well.
"This app is a remote to control most JVC projectors. In order to work properly, please ensure you have done the following:
1. Your phone and your projector must be on the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure your projector is connected via an Ethernet cable to your network.
2. In your projector settings, the option to enable the network must be turned ON. You can most likely use the buttons at the back of the projector to access the menu, and enable the option there.
3. Once your projector is on the same network as your phone, you can use the Auto-Detect button to find the IP of your projector. Or, if that doesn't work you can find the IP by accessing your router and finding your projector there, then input it manually into the Projector IP field
4. After you found the IP from auto detection or inputting it manually, you can connect to the projector by pressing the Connect button.
5. You can now turn the projector on by pressing the ON button, or if you're done using it you can press the OFF button.
6. The rest of the buttons are just like the remote, the arrow keys are used for navigation, the menu button is used to access the menu, the back button is used to go back, etc.
7. If you have any issues, please post an issue in the issues section of the repository.
Note: This app only works with ONE projector on the network. If you have multiple, then you must find the IP of the one you wish to control and type it into the field above.
